					<section>
						well let's start by talking about tables
					</section>

					<section>
						why do we (the bureau) create and disseminate tables?
					</section>

					<section>
						check out this popular product
						<hr>
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/dp5.jpg" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
					  what is the purpose of a dp table?
						<hr>
						<ul>
							<li>
					    	what is it trying to do?
							</li>
							<li>
								what is the intent behind it?
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>


					<section>
						it's based on a few assumptions about our customers:
						<hr>
						<ol>
							<li>
					      they're looking for a breadth of topics
							</li>
							<li>
								they know what they're looking at
							</li>
							<li>
					      they are going to consume it statically
							</li>
						</ol>
					</section>

					<section>
						but wait: these are testable assumptions
						<hr>
						let's consider them
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							regarding breadth: why does it include some things and not others?
						</p>
						<hr>
						<p style='font-style:italic'>
					  	who said average commute should be in there?
							<br>
							what about when folks left for work?
							<br>
							what about the commuting pattern for women vets?
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						do the users know what they are looking at?
						<hr>
						<p style='font-style:italic'>
								can they explain the differences between 1 and 5 year products?
								<br>
								do they know what ACS is?
								<br>
								do they understand what we mean by 'unemployed'?
							</p>

					</section>

					<section>
						do the users really just consume the table statically?
						<hr>
						<p style='font-style:italic'>
							what're they doing with it?
							<br>
							what do they need it for?
							<br>
							what brought them to the table in the first place?
						</p>

					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>
					  		what user research was done in crafting these products?
							</li>
							<li>
					  		when was it done?
							</li>
							<li>
					  		what feedback do we collect about them today?
							</li>
							<li>
								does this research make it back to product development?
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						so who are the customers?
					</section>

					<section>
						we have a few basic groups
						<hr>
						<ul style='font-size:.8em'>
							<li>
								<span style="background-color:green;color:white">Green</span>: Developers or people who want to do advanced modeling/programming with the data
							</li>
							<li>
								<span style="background-color:lime">Lime</span>: AFF users who want to access tables and mainly volume data, and potentially build something or incorporate a layer into their own tool
							</li>
							<li>
								<span style="background-color:yellow">Yellow</span>: Yellow - AFF users who want to download volume data and then run stats and/or manipulate data
							</li>
							<li>
								<span style="background-color:orange">Orange</span>: Orange - Show me the #s on the site or let me download just the data I need but I'm not that technical
							</li>
							<li>
								<span style="background-color:darkblue;color:white">Blue</span>: Small scale, informal data consumer, not familiar with Census data holdings and just wants to see raw number on the site
							</li>
						</ul>
						<!-- <img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/user-types.jpg" alt=""> -->
					</section>
					<section>
						<ol>
							<li>
								How are different user types currently searching for and interacting with data?
							</li>
							<li>
								What defines the “right” result format and content for different user types?
							</li>
							<li>
								How can we help folks discover Census data?
							</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<table style="width:100%;font-size:.5em">
						  <tr>
						    <th>User cluster</th>
						    <th>Map needs/preferences</th>
						    <th>Table needs/preferences</th>

					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							 But what about the fundamental question:
							 <hr>
							 <span class="italics">
								 why do users use this product?
							 </span>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						From our analytics we know some products are more popular than others.
						<hr>
							DP tables are popular.
							<br>
						 	so are GCTs.
					</section>
					<section>
							Ok - why?
					</section>
					<section>
				    is it their tasteful indentations?
					</section>
					<section>
						<div>
							<p style="font-family: helvetica; font-size:8.5em;background-color:#DA2727;color:white;font-style:oblique">Nope</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						it's the context
						<hr>
						<!-- Who cares what the population is in one place if it's not in contrast to its siblings? Far more powerful to understand the distribution than a datum. -->
						<ul>
							<li>
								they have mass appeal
							</li>
							<li>
								they are easily digestable
							</li>
							<li>
								DP tables provide a nice intro to a topic
							</li>
							<li>
				      	GCTs are essentially a thematic map.
							</li>
							<li>
				      	Also explains GRTs.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						but
						<hr>
						they aren't the easiest to discover, access, or consume
					</section>
					<section>
						and that's a big problem
					</section>

				</section>

				<section>

					<section>
						so why are our products hard to discover?
					</section>

					<section>
						we get wrapped up in the delivery mechanisms
					</section>

					<section>
						AFF, CBB, Quickfacts...
					</section>

					<section>
						which has led to this
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/current-state.png" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
						we need to get to this
						<br>
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/arch.png" alt="">

					</section>

				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						ok, then what about access and consume?
					</section>
					<section>the landscape has shifted</section>
					<section>
						compute cycles are a commodity.
					</section>
					<section>
						  a general users now have access to hardware and software that was previously only available on a supercomputer.
					</section>
					<section>
						    data transactions are fast.
					</section>
					<section>
						 it's cheaper to just pull everything and see what's up
					</section>
					<section>
						tooling has changed
					</section>
					<section>
					  languages have evolved
						<hr>
					  R/Python/js/julia/sas
					</section>
					<section>
					  storage has evolved
						<hr>
					  large/cheap/linked data stores
					</section>
					<section>
						workflows have evolved
						<hr>
						IDEs/collaboration/workbooks get better every day
					</section>
					<section>
						methods have changed
						<hr>
					  unsupervised learning methods are the new hotness so now everyone is data starved.
					</section>
					<section>
					  in their documentation, tensorflow actually points to a census data set as a starter guide.
					</section>
					<section>
						BUT...
					</section>
					<section>
						look at this!
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/tensor.jpg" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/tensor-zoom.jpg" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						they point to a 3rd party for the data; and
						<br>
						include a cleaning script; AND
						<br>
						var mappings because OF COURSE THEY NEEDED TO!
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						so what are we doing about it?
					</section>


					<!-- <section>
						the vision
						<hr>
							make Census data discoverable, accessible, and consumable
					</section> -->

					<!-- <section>
						the challenge
						<hr>
						the data are numerous, complex, and not as interoperable as you might think
						we also need to make it easier on ourselves
					</section> -->

					<section>
						<!-- the approach
						<hr> -->
						start with the user, standardize everything, and then automate as much as possible.
					</section>

					<section data-background-color="#4E5057">
						<img style="border:none;box-shadow:none;background:none;" width="30%" src="img/cedsci-logo.png" alt="">
						<h3>CEDSCI</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						the approach

					<section>
						our building blocks

					<section>
						how we build
						<br>
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/edde-engine.png" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
						so what does this look like?
					</section>

					<section>
						start with search
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/pi13-homepage.png" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
						help folks understand what's available
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/all-new.png" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
						provide easy ways into the data
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/pi13-profile.png" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
						cover the basics
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/tables-new.png" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
						extend the options
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/map-new.png" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
						and go from this
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/google-orig.png" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
						to this
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/google-future.png" alt="">
					</section>

				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						but here's the kicker
					</section>
					<section>
						we can only do so much
					</section>
					<section>
						so we need enable others
					</section>
					<section>
						third party devs are first class citizens
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/devexLanding.png" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						we are API first
						<br>
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/Tables.png" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						to get them working with data faster
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/devexQueryBuilder.png" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						we want to help them with examples
						<img class="stretch" style="border:none" src="./img/devexSamplesHome.png" alt="">
